I use All-in-One WP Migration plugin to export site and also export directly from PHPMyAdmin.
It's under database folder.

I use Font Awesome on the right social bar instead of the icons that I don't see inside icon folder because I just want to tell that I like to use this one.

Each section below header use Grid Layout and Flex Layout because I just want to tell that I can use it as well, not might be only Bootstrap or anothers.

Title and Content of each section control by Theme option that built from Redux Framework. Thinking about naming each section is wasting time, so I will do it later.

I grab the media query breakpoint from Bootstrap and fixed only on mobile potriat.

I don't have DIN font and I don't see it on Google fonts, that why I leave it like that.

I've registerd Service post_type and attached custom field by ACF plugin. Basically use for icon and icon when mouse over on Frontpage, Surely we can add anything we want. 

Anyway! I don't see exactly icon inside the folder, so I just edit icon for only the first service box. You can go to edit each service like normal post and just add icon and icon hover image there.
